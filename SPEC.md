# Vidsy Interview Task

## Introduction

The Vidsy team would like you to implement a web crawler in Go. This is a
classic engineering problem that they feel covers a number of software
engineering principles whilst also being interesting for you to work on!

> a search engine that scans web pages looking for links and then follows them._

The exercise described below tasks you with implementing the foundation of a web
crawler. The test is an opportunity to showcase your technical ability and
